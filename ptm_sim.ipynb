    "To achieve a high-quality protein simulation, we apply as many parameters as possible from the SMIRNOFF port of Amber ff14sb. This includes charges, LJ parameters, and valence parameters for the canonical amino acids and NME/ACE caps. As with all SMIRNOFF-format force fields, these are applied via direct chemical perception as specified by SMARTS substructures. The remaining atoms LJ and valence parameters are filled in from Sage, while charges come from NAGL. NAGL allows AM1BCC partial charges for the entire protein to be computed from a graph neural network without having to run a much more expensive QC calculation on such a large molecule."

Residues are loaded by matching atom names from the PDB file to the residue definitions defined for that residue name, and using the chemical information from the `ResidueDefinition` to determine the detailed chemical information needed to load an OpenFF Topology. Multiple residue definitions can be provided for a given residue name; if they disagree about how to assign chemical information to a particular residue in a PDB file, an error is raised.
