    "We'd love to be able to just pull down any old PDB file and parametrize it, but the cost of being able to directly parametrize nearly any drug-like molecule is that we do need to know exactly what that molecule is, including its bond orders and formal charges. Unfortunately, PDBs just don't include that information. The Pablo loader tries to make it as easy as possible to load PDB files with chemistries both unusual and mundane!\n",
    "\n",
    "The new Pablo PDB loader uses a unified [`ResidueDefinition`] dataclass to specify how to load a particular residue. Pablo can use residue definitions that don't specify atom and residue names as long as elements and connectivity are present in the PDB file, and it can use residue definitions that can infer connectivity from atom and residue names by specifying those names. Pablo's default residue library supports many PTM residues, as it includes support for loading residue definitions from the [CCD]. For this example however, we'll define our own definition for a novel post-translation modification. We'll use a so-called \"anonymous\" definition, because it saves us having to deal with the names, and because most software can produce PDB files with CONECT records for nonstandard residues.\n",
